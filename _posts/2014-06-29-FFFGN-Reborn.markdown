![Dallas Game Night Logo](/images/DallasGameNight.png){: .right-img } The Fourth Friday Family Game Night (aka #FFFGN) has been reborn as the Dallas Game Night!  We've decided the group needed an upgrade so I'm pleased to report that we now have:

1. A Twitter account : [@DallasGameNight](http://Twitter.com/DallasGameNight)
1. [A real website](http://DallasGameNight.TimRayburn.net)

While we've upgraded our internet fidelity, the mission remains the same: Provide a free and open night for board games that is kid friendly, for the love of games!

We will meet next on July 25th, 2014 and we invite you to join us.  Click the link below to register.
